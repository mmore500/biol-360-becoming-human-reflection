ideas
\begin{itemize}
  \item I had NO idea that other hominids were around so recently! If we were to find a surviving population, what would our responsibility be? Could we put them in a zoo? Assimilate them into human culture? Would we have a special obligation to protect them?
  \item paleo diets and other fads
  \item humans adapted to change itself and climate change
  \item babies and sharing caregiving
  \item can learning take place only during childhood? are barriers to learning in adulthood social or actually have to do with the state of the brain?
  \item was there a single origin of bipedalism? if bipedalism is more efficient, why isn't it observed in other animals (Kangaroos?(
  \item intelligent not equal social
  \item the film identifies culture as one of the big questions in human evolution will there ever be a rigorous way to study this? especially from a biologist's point of view?
\end{itemize}

And finally, I have a laundry list of criticisms of the documentary. I think that the series was really valuable, but it could be a lot better.
\begin{itemize}
  \item the visualizations were a bit jarring (reusing their big budget shots)
  \item dismissal of scientific controversy (I felt that they were just presenting the most convenient/narratively intriguing theories)
  \item human exceptionalism and speaking in superlatives (we conquered the earth)
  \item can science be interesting if the camera isn't moving all the time? apparently not.
\end{itemize}
